Iup/Ada is an Ada binding for the [Iup
library](http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/). Iup itself is a multi-platform
toolkit for building graphical user interfaces. You cat use Iup on Unix (the
backend is GTK) and in Windows (the backend uses the Windows API).

This is a thin binding that you can use with the Gnat Ada compiler.
